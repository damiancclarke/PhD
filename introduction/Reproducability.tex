\textbf{A Note on Authorship}
\end{center}

Chapters \ref{chap:fert}, \ref{chap:pill} and \ref{chap:spill} were written 
alone.  Chapter \ref{chap:twins} was coauthored with Professor Sonia Bhalotra, 
to whom I am indebeted for her willingness to share knowledge.  The work is 
indeed a co-authored project, which has evolved over a number of years.  Both 
authors have made substantive contributions to the ideas, derivations and 
empirical results presented in the paper.

\textbf{A Note on Reproducability}
\end{center}

\noindent In the interests of openness, code to replicate the entirety of this 
thesis is publicly available for inspection at 
\href{https://github.com/damiancclarke/PhD}{http://github.com/damiancclarke/PhD}. 
This code allows any and all interested 
parties to fully generate any result from the thesis.  All code is released 
under the GNU General Public License, implying that it is free software.  The 
thesis can be replicated from source (including the download of publicly 
available data) on any machine, provided that a number of languages or compilers 
are installed.  These requirements are (the free) Python, R, Octave, Fortran, 
git and LaTeX, and the (non-free) Stata.  Replicating the entire analysis is 
relatively easy.  On a Unix machine: 
\vspace{1mm} \\
\indent\texttt{\$ git clone https://github.com/damiancclarke/PhD.git}\\
\indent\texttt{\$ make}
\vspace{1mm} \\
runs the entirety of the analysis from source.  Full details are provided at: \\
