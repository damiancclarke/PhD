\begin{chapabstract}
I propose a method for difference-in-differences (DD) estimation in situations 
where the stable unit treatment value assumption is violated locally. This is
relevant for a wide variety of cases where spillovers may occur between quasi-%
treatment and quasi-control areas in a (natural) experiment. A flexible 
methodology is described to test for such spillovers, and to consistently 
estimate treatment effects in their presence. This methodology is applied to two 
empirical examples.

\section{Introduction}
Natural experiments often rely on territorial borders to estimate treatment 
effects.  These borders separate quasi-treatment from quasi-control groups with
individuals in one area having access to a program or treatment while those in 
another do not.  In cases such as these where geographic location is used to 
motivate identification, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) is, 
either explicitly or implicitly, invoked.\footnote{The SUTVA has a long and 
interesting history, under various guises. \citet{Cox1958} refers to ``no 
interference between different units'', before \citet{Rubin1978} introduced the 
concept of SUTVA (the name SUTVA did not appear until \citet{Rubin1980}).  
Recent work of \citet{Manski2013}, refers to this assumption as Individualistic 
Treatment Response (ITR).}

However, often territorial borders are porous.  Generally state, regional,
municipal, and village boundaries can be easily, if not costlessly, crossed.
Given this, researchers interested in using natural experiments in this way may
be concerned that the effects of a program in a treatment cluster may spillover 
into non-treatment clusters---at least locally.

Such a situation is in clear violation of the SUTVA's requirement that the 
treatment status of any one unit must not affect the outcomes of any other unit.  
In this paper I propose a methodology to deal with such spillover effects.  I
discuss how to test for local spillovers, and if such spillovers exist, how to 
estimate unbiased treatment effects in their presence.  It is shown that this 
estimation requires a weaker condition than SUTVA: namely that SUTVA holds 
between \emph{some} units, as determined by their distance from the treatment 
cluster.  I show how to estimate treatment and spillover effects, and then
propose a method to generalise the proposed estimator to a higher dimensional 
case where spillovers may depend in a flexible way on an arbitrary number of 
factors.

It is shown that this methodology recovers unbiased treatment estimates under 
quite general violations of SUTVA.  While it is assumed that the distance of 
an individual to the nearest treatment cluster determines whether stable unit 
treatment type assumptions hold for that individual, `distance' is defined 
very broadly.  It is envisioned that this will allow for phenomena such as 
information flowing from treated to untreated areas, or of untreated 
individuals violating their treatment status by travelling from untreated to
treated areas.  In each case distance plays a clear role in the propogation 
of treatment; either information must travel out, or beneficiaries must travel 
in. Similarly, this framework allows for local general equilibrium-type 
spillovers, where a tightly applied program may have an economic effect on 
nearby markets, but where this effect disipates as distance to treatment 
increases.

Turning to empirics, this methodology is illustrated with two examples.
I examine how spillovers of reforms across municipal boundaries may 
contaminate `traditional' difference-in-differences (DD) estimators.  This is 
applied to two contraceptive reforms, where individuals from contiguous or nearby 
areas can travel to a treatment region to access the reform.  It is shown that 
both the arrival of the morning after pill to certain municipalities of Chile, 
and abortion to certain districts in Mexico, results in a reduction of births in 
the given area, as well as in close-by quasi-control areas.  As a result, the 
spillover-robust DD estimator propsed here flexibly captures this effect, 
correcting for any (local) spillover bias that traditional DD fails to 
identify.

This paper joins recent literature which aims to loosen the strong structure 
imposed by the SUTVA.  Perhaps most notably, it is (in broad terms) an 
application of \citeauthor{Manski2013}'s (2013) social interactions framework, 
focusing on the case where spillovers are restricted to areas local to treatment 
clusters.  However, unlike recent developments focusing on spillovers 
between treated and control units \emph{within} a treatment cluster (notable
examples include \citet{McIntosh2008,Bairdetal2014,AngelucciDiMaro2010}), this 
paper focuses on situations where entire clusters are treated, and the status
of the \emph{cluster} may affect nearby non-treated clusters.  This is likely
the case for quasi-experimental studies, where `experiments' are defined based
on geographic boundaries, such as administrative political regions which set 
different policies.\footnote{A very different case is that of (for example)
PROGRESA/Oportunidades, where treatment clusters (ie localities or 
\emph{localidades}) contained both treatment and control individuals, and the
literature is concerned with spillovers between treatment and control individuals
within this treatment cluster.}

%================================================================================
\section{Methodology}
Define $Y(i,t)$ as the outcome for individual $i$ and time $t$.  The population
of interest is observed at two time periods, $t\in \{0,1\}$. Assume that between
$t=0$ and $t=1$, some fraction of the population is exposed to a 
quasi-experimental treatment.  As per \citet{Abadie2005}, we will denote 
treatment for individual $i$ in time $t$ as $D(i,t)$, where $D(i,1)=1$ implies 
that the individual was treated, and $D(i,1)=0$ implies that the individual was
not directly treated.  Given that treatment only exists between periods 0 and 1,
$D(i,0)=0\ \forall\ i$.

It is shown by \citet{AshenfelterCard1985} that if the outcome is generated by
a component of variance process:
\begin{equation}
\label{Seqn:COV}
Y(i,t)=\delta(t) + \alpha D(i,t)+\eta(i)+\nu(i,t)
\end{equation}
where $\delta(t)$ refers to a time-specific component, $\alpha$ as the impact of 
treatment, $\eta(i)$ a component specific to each individual, and $\nu(i,t)$ as 
a time-varying individual (mean zero) shock, then a sufficient condition for 
identification (a complete derivation is provided by \citet{Abadie2005}) is:
\begin{equation}
\label{Seqn:ID}
P(D(i,1)=1|\nu(i,t))=P(D(i,1)=1) \ \forall\ t\in\{0,1\}.
\end{equation}
In other words, identification requires that selection into treatment does not
rely on the unobserved time-varying component $\nu(i,t)$.  If this condition 
holds, then the classical DD estimator provides an unbiased estimate of the
treatment effect:
\begin{equation}
\label{Seqn:DD}
\begin{split}
\alpha&=\{\mathbb{E}[Y(i,1)|D(i,1)=1]-\mathbb{E}[Y(i,1)|D(i,1)=0]\} \\
      &-\{\mathbb{E}[Y(i,0)|D(i,1)=1]-\mathbb{E}[Y(i,0)|D(i,1)=0]\}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Assume now, however, that treatment is not precisely geographically bounded.  
Specifically, imagine that those living in control areas `close to' treatment 
areas are able to access treatment, either partially or completely.  Such a 
case allows for a case where individuals `defy' their treatment status, by 
travelling or moving to treated areas, or where spillovers from treatment 
areas is diffused through general equilibrium processes.  Define $R(i,t)$ 
where:
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
 R(i,t) =
  \begin{cases}
   f\Big(X(i,t)\Big)   & \text{if an individual resides close to, but not in, a treatment area} \\
   0                            & \text{otherwise} 
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Where $X(i,t)$ is an individual covariate measuring distance (in a very general 
sense) to treatment. As treatment occurs only in 
period 1, $R(i,0)=0$ for all $i$.  Similarly, as living in a treatment area 
itself excludes individuals from living `close to' the same treament area, 
$R(i,t)=0$ for all $i$ such that $D(i,t)=1$.

Generalising from (\ref{Seqn:COV}), now we assume that $Y(i,t)$ is generated 
by:
\begin{equation}
\label{Seqn:COV2}
Y(i,t)=\delta(t) + \alpha D(i,t)+\beta R(i,t)+\eta(i)+\nu(i,t)
\end{equation}
If we observe only $Y(i,t)$, $D(i,t)$ and $R(i,t)$, a sufficient condition for 
estimation now consists of (\ref{Seqn:ID}) and the following assumption: 
\begin{equation}
\label{Seqn:ID2}
P(R(i,1)\neq 0|\nu(i,t))=P(R(i,1)\neq 0) \ \forall\ t\in\{0,1\}.
\end{equation}
This requires that both treatment, and being close to treatment cannot depend 
upon individual-specific time-variant components. To see this, write 
(\ref{Seqn:COV2}), adding and subtracting $\mathbb{E}[\eta(i)|D(i,1),
R(i,1)]$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Seqn:addsub}
Y(i,t)=\delta(t) + \alpha D(i,t)+\beta R(i,t)+\mathbb{E}[\eta(i)|D(i,1),R(i,1)]+\varepsilon(i,t)
\end{equation}
where, following \citet{Abadie2005}, $\varepsilon(i,t)=\eta(i)-\mathbb{E}[\eta(i)|D(i,1),R(i,1)]
+\nu(i,t)$.  We can write $\delta(t)=\delta(0)+[\delta(1)-\delta(0)]t$, and write
$\mathbb{E}[\eta(i)|D(i,1),R(i,1)]$ as the sum of the expectation of the individual-specific 
component $\eta(i)$ over treatment status and `close' status\footnote{$\mathbb{E}[\eta(i)|
D(i,1),R(i,1)]=\mathbb{E}[\eta(i)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)=0]+(\mathbb{E}[\eta(i)|D(i,1)=1,
R(i,1)=0]-\mathbb{E}[\eta(i)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)=0])\cdot D(i,1)+(\mathbb{E}[\eta(i)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)\neq 0]-
\mathbb{E}[\eta(i)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)=0])\cdot R(i,1)$.}.  Finally define $\mu$ as 
$\mu=\mathbb{E}[\eta(i)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)=0]+\delta_0$, $\tau$ as $\tau=\mathbb{E}[\eta(i)|D(i,1)=1,R(i,1)
=0]-\mathbb{E}[\eta(i)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)=0]$, $\gamma$ as $\gamma=\mathbb{E}[\eta(i)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)\neq 0]-
\mathbb{E}[\eta(i)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)=0]$ and $\delta$ as $\delta=\delta(1)-\delta(0)$.  Then 
from the above and (\ref{Seqn:addsub})
we have:
\begin{equation}
\label{Seqn:cDD}
Y(i,t)=\mu+\tau D(i,1) + \gamma R(i,1) + \delta t + \alpha D(i,t) + \beta R(i,t) + 
       \varepsilon(i,t).
\end{equation}
Notice that this equation now includes the typical DD fixed effects $\tau$ and $\delta$
and the double difference term $\alpha$.  However it also includes `close' analogues
$\gamma$ (an initial fixed effect), and $\beta$: the effect of being `close to' a 
treatment area.

From the assumptions in (\ref{Seqn:ID}) and (\ref{Seqn:ID2}) it holds that 
$\mathbb{E}[(1,D(i,1),R(i,1),D(i,t),$
$R(i,t))\cdot\varepsilon(i,t)]=0$, which 
implies that all parameters from (\ref{Seqn:cDD}) are consistently estimable 
by OLS.  Importantly, this includes consistent estimates of $\alpha$ and 
$\beta$: the effect of the program treatment and spillover effects on 
outcome variable $Y(i,t)$.  Then, from (\ref{Seqn:cDD}), a our coefficients 
of interest $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are:
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\label{Seqn:DDa}
\begin{split}
\alpha&=\{\mathbb{E}[Y(i,1)|D(i,1)=1,R(i,1)=0]-\mathbb{E}[Y(i,1)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)=0]\} \\
      &-\{\mathbb{E}[Y(i,0)|D(i,1)=1,R(i,1)=0]-\mathbb{E}[Y(i,0)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)=0]\}, 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\label{Seqn:DDb}
\begin{split}
\beta&=\{\mathbb{E}[Y(i,1)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)\neq 0]-\mathbb{E}[Y(i,1)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)=0]\} \\
      &-\{\mathbb{E}[Y(i,0)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)\neq 0]-\mathbb{E}[Y(i,0)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)=0]\}. 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where the sample estimate of each parameter is generated by a least squares
regression of (\ref{Seqn:cDD}) using a random sample of 
$\{Y(i,t), D(i,t), R(i,t): i=1, \ldots, N, t=0, 1\}$.

%================================================================================
\section{A Spillover-Robust Double Differences Estimator}
\label{Sscn:estim}
We are interested in estimating difference-in-difference parameters $\alpha$ and 
$\beta$ from (\ref{Seqn:cDD}).  We will refer to these estimators respectively
as the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), and the average treatment
effect on the close to treated (ATC).  Average treatment effects are cast in 
terms of the \citet{Rubin1974} Causal Model.

Following a potential outcome framework, we denote $Y^1(i,t)$ as the potential
outcome for some person $i$ at time $t$ if they were to receive treatment, and
$Y^0(i,t)$ if the person were not to receive treatment.  Our ATT and ATC are
thus:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{Seqn:estimATT}
ATT=\mathbb{E}[Y^1(i,1)-Y^0(i,1)|D(i,1)=1]\  \\
\label{Seqn:estimATC}
ATC=\mathbb{E}[Y^1(i,1)-Y^0(i,1)|C(i,1)= 0],
\end{eqnarray}
where we define a new binary variable $C(i,t)$, which indicates if individuals 
are close or not close to treatment.  This is simply a redefinition of $R(i,t)$,
where $C(i,t)=\mathbf{1}_{R(i,t)\neq 0}$.  Given that for now we are interested
in the \emph{average} effect on those close to treatment we condition only on
$C(i,t)$, however in the sections which follow extend to a more general form of
$R(i,t)$ to examine the rate of decay or propogations of spillovers over space.

As is typical in the potential outcome literature, estimation is hindered by the
reality that only one of $Y^1(i,t)$ or $Y^0(i,t)$ is observed for a given 
individual $i$ at time $t$.  The realised outcome can thus be expressed as 
$Y(i,t)=Y^0(i,t)\cdot (1-D(i,t))(1-C(i,t))+Y^1(i,t)\cdot D(i,t)+Y^1(i,t)\cdot 
C(i,t)$, where, depending on an individual's time varying treatment and close
status, we observe either $Y^0(i,t)$ (untreated) or $Y^1(i,t)$ (treated or 
close).  Thus, in order to be able to estimate the quantities of interest, we 
rely on averages over the entire population, rather than average of individual 
treatment effects.  As is typical in difference-in-differences identification
strategies, consistent estimation requires parallel trends assumptions.  In the 
case of treatment \emph{and} local spillovers, this relies on:

\begin{assumption}{1}{}
\label{Sass:PT}
\textbf{Parallel trends in treatment and control:} \\
$\mathbb{E}[Y^0(i,1)-Y^0(i,0)|D(i,1)=1,C(i,1)=0]=
\mathbb{E}[Y^0(i,1)-Y^0(i,0)|D(i,1)=0,C(i,1)=0]$,
\end{assumption}
\begin{assumption}{2}{}
\label{Sass:PTC}
\textbf{Parallel trends in close and control:} \\
$\mathbb{E}[Y^0(i,1)-Y^0(i,0)|D(i,1)=0,C(i,1)=1]=
\mathbb{E}[Y^0(i,1)-Y^0(i,0)|D(i,1)=0,C(i,1)=0]$.
\end{assumption}

In other words, assumption \ref{Sass:PT} and \ref{Sass:PTC} state that in the 
absence of treatment, the evolution of outcomes for treated units and for units 
close to treatment would have been parallel to the evolution of entirely 
untreated units.  This is the fundamental DD identifying assumption of parallel 
trends, generalised to hold for treatment \emph{and} close to treatment status.  
Note that in the above, we no longer need to make \emph{any} assumptions 
regarding parallel trends between treatment and close to treatment units 
allowing for direct interactions between close to treatment and treatment units. 

However, as a matter of course, in order to consistently estimate any treatment 
effect, some form of the SUTVA must be invoked.  Typically, this requires that 
each individual's treatment status does not affect each other individual's 
potential outcome.  Here, we loosen SUTVA. In the remainder of this article, it 
will be assumed that:
\begin{assumption}{3}{}
\label{Sass:SUTVAs}
\textbf{SUTVA holds for some units:} \\
There is some subset of individuals $j\in J$ of the total population $i\in N$ 
for whom potential outcomes ($Y_j^0, Y_j^1$) are independent of the treatment 
status $D=\{0,1\}\ \forall_{i\neq j} \in N$.
\end{assumption}
\vspace{-4mm}
\noindent Fundamentally, this assumption implies that SUTVA need not hold among 
all units.  Now, rather than identification relying on each unit not affecting 
each other unit, it relies on there existing at least some subset of units which 
are not affected by the treatment status of others.\footnote{This is an 
identifying assumption. If all `non-treatment' units are affected by spillovers 
from the treatment area, a consistent treatment effect cannot be estimated using 
this methodology. This is a general rule and can be couched in 
\citet{HeckmanVytlacil2005}'s terms: `The treatment effect literature 
investigates a class of policies that have partial participation at a point in 
time so there is a ``treatment'' group and a ``comparison'' group. It is not 
helpful in evaluating policies that have universal participation.' (or in this 
case, universal participation and spillovers.}

Finally, we assume that spillovers, or violations of SUTVA, do not occur randomly
in the population:
\begin{assumption}{4}{A}
\label{Sass:SUTVAl}
\textbf{Assignment to close to treatment depends on observable $X(i,t)$:} \\ 
There exists an assignment rule $\delta\Big(X(i,t)\Big)=\{0,1\}$ which maps 
individuals to close to treatment status $C(i,t)$, where $\delta\Big(X(i,t)\Big)=
\mathbf{1}_{X(i,t)<d}$, $X(i,t)$ is an observed covariate, and $d$ is a fixed
%but unknown (though reveal this and how to estimate it later)
scalar cutoff. 
\end{assumption}
\vspace{-4mm}
\noindent This restriction is quite general.  In other words, it simply states 
that violations of SUTVA occur in an observable way.  For example, if SUTVA does
not hold locally to the treatment area, assumption \asref{Sass:SUTVAl}{A} implies
that we are able to define what `local' is.  While this article focuses on
an $X_i$ representing geographic distance, these derivations do not imply that 
this must be the case.  The `close' indicator $C(i,t)$ could depend on a range 
of phenomena including euclidean space, ethnic distance, edges between
nodes in a network, or, as we return to discuss in section
\ref{Ssscn:multi}, multi-dimensional interactions between measures such as these 
and economic variables. 
\begin{proposition}
\label{Pass:ATT}
Under assumptions \ref{Sass:PT} to \asref{Sass:SUTVAl}{A}, the ATT and ATC can be 
consistently estimated by least squares when controlling, parametrically or
non-parametrically, for $C(i,t)=\mathbf{1}_{X(i,t)\leq d}$.
\end{proposition}
\noindent In the following two subsections we examine these estimands in turn. 

%================================================================================
\subsection{Estimating the Treatment Effect in the Presence of Spillovers}
\label{Ssscn:TE}
From proposition \ref{Pass:ATT}, we can consistently estimate $\alpha$ and 
$\beta$, our estimands of interest, with information on treatment status, and 
close to treatment status, along with outcomes $Y(i,t)$ at each point in time. In 
a typical DD framework, we observe $Y(i,t)$ and $D(i,t)$, however, do not fully 
observe $C(i,t)$, an individual's close/non-close status.

We do however, assume that $X(i,t)$, the variable measuring `distance' to 
treatment is observed. From assumption \asref{Sass:SUTVAl}{A}, we could thus map 
$X(i,t)$ to $C(i,t)$ (and later to the heterogeneous function $R(i,t)$) using the 
indicator function, \emph{if} we know the scalar value $d$, which represents the 
threshold of what is considered `close to treatment'. \emph{Ex ante}, in the 
absence some economic model, there is no reason to believe that $d$ will be 
observed by researchers.\footnote{That is not to say that economic intuition 
cannot play a role in suggesting what a reasonable value of $d$ might be. For 
example, if treatment is the receipt of a program with a clear expected value and 
travel costs to access the program increase with distance, there will exist a 
clear cut-off point beyond which individuals will be unwilling to travel. 
Similarly, if treatment must be accessed in a fixed amount of time and 
propogation of treatment is not instantaneous, a limit for $d$ may be calculable. 
This is a point we return to in empirical estimates where one illustration is 
based on access to the emergency contraceptive pill.}  In the remainder of this 
section we discuss how to determine $C(i,t)$ based on $X(i,t)$, in the absence of 
a known value for $d$.

In order to do so, we re-write (\ref{Seqn:cDD}) as:
\begin{equation}
\label{Seqn:cDDconc}
\tilde{Y}(i,t)=\mu + \alpha D(i,t) + \upsilon(i,t).
\end{equation}
where $\upsilon(i,t)=\beta R(i,t)+\varepsilon(i,t)$, and for ease of notation
the fixed effects $D(i,1), R(i,1)$ and $t$ have been concentrated out to form
$\tilde{Y}(i,t)$.  If we were to estimate $\hat\alpha$ from the above regression
ignoring the potential presence of spillovers, then we have that the expectation 
of $\hat\alpha$ is:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{Seqn:alphaExp}
\mathbb{E}[\hat\alpha] &=& \alpha + \beta\Bias{D(i,t)}{R(i,t)}+\Bias{D(i,t)}{\varepsilon(i,t)} \nonumber \\ 
              &=& \alpha + \beta\Bias{D(i,t)}{R(i,t)},
\end{eqnarray}
where the second line comes from (\ref{Seqn:ID}), which implies that 
$E[\Cov(D(i,t),\varepsilon(i,t))]=0$.  So far we have attached no functional form 
to $R(i,t)$.  Define $R(i,t)$ as:
\begin{equation}
\label{Seqn:Runpack}
R(i,t) = \beta_1R^1(i,t)+\beta_2R^2(i,t)+ \cdots + \beta_KR^K(i,t)
\end{equation}  
where:
\begin{equation}
\label{Seqn:Rpar}
 R^k(i,t) =
  \begin{cases}
   1   & \text{if\ \ } X_i\geq(k-1)\cdot h \text{\ \ and \ } X_i<k\cdot h \\
   0   & \text{otherwise} 
  \end{cases}\ \ \ \ \ \forall k \in (1,2,\ldots,K).
\end{equation}
In the above expression $h$ refers to a bandwidth type parameter, which 
partitions the continuous distance variable $X_i$ into groups of distance $h$.%
\footnote{So, if for example $X_i$ refers to physical distance to treatment and 
the minimum and maximum distances are 0 and 100km respectively, $h$ could be set 
as 5km, resulting in 20 different indicators $R^k$, of which each individual $i$ 
in time $t$ can have at most one switched on.}

From the above, we have partitioned $X_i$ into $K$ different groups. However, we
are still unable to say anything about the distance $d$ above which spillovers no 
longer occur. From assumptions \ref{Sass:PTC} and \ref{Sass:SUTVAs}, we do 
however know that $d<Kh$, implying that there are at least some units for whom 
spillovers do not occur.  From (\ref{Seqn:Runpack}) and the preceding logic, this 
suggests that $d$ can be recovered following the iterative procedure laid out 
below, so long as $R(i,t)=f(X(i,t))$ is montononic in $X$.

If we start by estimating a typical DD specification like (\ref{Seqn:cDDconc}),
our estimated treatment effect, which we now denote $\hat\alpha^0$ is:
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\begin{split}
\mathbb{E}[\hat\alpha^0]=\alpha + \beta\beta_1\Bias{D(i,t)}{R^1(i,t)}
                                + \beta\beta_2\Bias{D(i,t)}{R^2(i,t)}
                                + \\ \ldots
                                + \beta\beta_K\Bias{D(i,t)}{R^K(i,t)}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
If spillovers exist below some distance $d$, then $\Cov[D(i,t),R^k(i,t)]>0 \ \ 
\forall \ \ kh<d$, given that $D(i,t)$---the treatment status in a treated area%
---affects the close to treated status in nearby areas. If this is the case, and 
if spillovers work in the same direction as treatment, then 
$|\mathbb{E}[\hat\alpha^0]|<|\alpha|$, implying that the estimated treatment 
effect will be attenuated by treatment spillover to the control group.  

We can then re-estimate (\ref{Seqn:cDDconc}), however now \emph{also} condition
out $R^1(i,t)$ prior to estimating $\alpha$.  Our resulting estimate, 
$\hat\alpha^1$, will have the expectation:
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\begin{split}
\mathbb{E}[\hat\alpha^1]=\alpha + \beta\beta_2\Bias{D(i,t)}{R^2(i,t)}
                                + \ldots
                                + \beta\beta_K\Bias{D(i,t)}{R^K(i,t)}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Once again, if spillovers exist and are of the same sign as treatment, then the
estimate $\hat\alpha^1$ will be attenuated, but not as badly as $\hat\alpha^0$ 
given that we now partially correct for spillovers up to a distance of $h$.  In 
this case: $|\mathbb{E}[\hat\alpha^0]|<|\mathbb{E}[\hat\alpha^1]|<|\alpha|$.  If, 
on the other hand, spillovers do not exist, then we will have that 
$|\mathbb{E}[\hat\alpha^0]|=|\mathbb{E}[\hat\alpha^1]|=|\alpha|$.  This leads to 
the following hypothesis test:
\[
H_0: \alpha^0=\alpha^1 \hspace{1cm}
H_1: \alpha^0\neq\alpha^1.
\]
If we reject $H_0$ in favour of the alternative, this suggests that partially 
correcting for spillovers affects the estimated coefficient $\alpha$, implying that
spillovers occur at least up to distance $h$, and that further tests are required.  

Rejection of the null suggests that another iteration should be performed, this time
removing $R^1(i,t)$ and $R^2(i,t)$ from the error term $\upsilon(i,t)$ in 
(\ref{Seqn:cDDconc}), and the corresponding 
parameter $\alpha^2$ be estimated.  If spillovers do occur at least up to distance 
$2c$, we expect that $|\mathbb{E}[\hat\alpha^0]|<|\mathbb{E}[\hat\alpha^1]|<
|\mathbb{E}[\hat\alpha^2]|<|\alpha|$, however if spillovers only occur up to distance
$c$, we will have $|\mathbb{E}[\hat\alpha^0]|<|\mathbb{E}[\hat\alpha^1]|=
|\mathbb{E}[\hat\alpha^2]|=|\alpha|$.  This leads to a new hypothesis test:
\[
H_0: \alpha^1=\alpha^2 \hspace{1cm}
H_1: \alpha^1\neq\alpha^2,
\]
where rejection of the null implies that spillovers occur at least up to distance
$2h$, while failure to reject the null suggests that spillovers only occur up to 
distance $h$.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This process should be followed iteratively up until the point that the marginal 
estimate $\hat\alpha^{k+1}$ is equal to the preceding estimate $\hat\alpha^{k}$.  
At this point, we can conclude that units at a distance of at least $kh$ from 
the nearest treatment unit are not affected by spillovers, and hence a 
consistent estimate of $\alpha$ can be produced. Finally, this leads to a 
conclusion regarding $d$ and the indicator function $C(i,t)=\mathbf{1}_{X(i,t)
\leq d}$.  When controlling for the marginal distance to treatment indicator no 
longer affects the estimate of the treatment effect $\alpha^k$, we can conclude 
that $d=kh$, and thus correctly identify $C(i,t)=\mathbf{1}_{X(i,t)\leq kh}$ in 
data.

%We follow \citet{PorterYu2014} in treating the cutoff point $d$ as a
%nuisance parameter which must be estimated.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Estimation the Magnitude of Spillovers}
\label{Ssscn:SE}
In section \ref{Ssscn:TE} we discuss the consistent estimation of $\alpha$, the
effect of being in a treatment area.  The extension of this methodology to 
consistently estimate $\beta$, the effect of being close to treatment, is 
reasonably straightforward.  Once the scalar value $d$ has been determined, and
with data $\{Y(i,t), D(i,t), X(i,t): i=1, \ldots, N, t=0, 1\}$ in hand, we can 
use $d$ to map $X(i,t)$ into $C(i,t)$. Given the above we can now estimate 
(\ref{Seqn:cDD}), and form consistent estimates $\hat\beta$ and $\hat\alpha$ 
using OLS.

The estimate $\hat\beta$ will be the average treated effect on the close to 
treated (ATC), and will be one summary value for all areas to which spillovers 
occur. However, more information regarding the precise manner of propogation can 
be observed by estimating with the re-parametrized $R(i,t)$ from 
(\ref{Seqn:Runpack}) instead of the indicator variable $C(i,t)$. This suggests 
an alternative spillover test, in the style of that proposed in section 
\ref{Ssscn:TE}.  Rather than observing $\hat\alpha^j$ at each stage of the 
estimation process, $\hat\beta^j$ can be directly observed. If 
$\hat\beta_j\neq 0$, this suggests that the effect on the marginal close to 
treatment area is different to the effect in the (remaining) control area. If 
spillovers are the estimand of interest, additional $R^j(i,t)$ controls can be 
added until the hypothesis: $H_0: \beta_j = 0$ cannot be rejected for the 
marginal parameter.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Estimating with Multidimensional Spillovers}
\label{Ssscn:multi}
Previously it has been assumed that $R(i,t)$ is a function of a unidimensional 
distance measure $X(i,t)$. I now generalise this to a multidimensional case 
where $R(i,t)$ may depend upon an arbitrary number of variables 
$\mathbf{X}(i,t)$. For example, this allows for cases where distance to 
treatment may interact with some other variable, such as income, ownership of 
a vehicle, etc. Now:
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
 R(i,t) =
  \begin{cases}
   f\Big(\mathbf{X}(i,t)\Big)   & \text{if an individual resides close to, but not in, a treatment area} \\
   0                            & \text{otherwise} 
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

In order to allow for spillovers to depend upon a range of observable variables,
we must generalise assumption \asref{Sass:SUTVAl}{A}.  In order to do this, the
following new terminology is introduced, following \citet{Zajonc2012}. An 
assignment rule, $\delta$, maps units with covariates $\mathbf{X=x}$ to close
assignment $r$:
\[
\delta: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \{0,1\}.
\]
This leads to a close-to-treatment assignment set $\mathbb{T}$ defined as:
\[
\mathbb{T}\equiv \{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{X}: \delta(\mathbf{x})=1 \}
\]
whose complement $\mathbb{T}^c$ is known as the control assignment
set. Finally then, we can write the treatment assignment rule:
\begin{equation}
\delta(x)\equiv \mathbf{1}_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{T}}.
\end{equation}
Having defined the treatment assignment rule, we can now provide a
more general version of assumption \asref{Sass:SUTVAl}{A}:

%\addtocounter{assumption}{-1}
\begin{assumption}{4}{B}
\label{Sass:SUTVAlM}
\textbf{Assignment to close to treatment depends on observable $\mathbf{X}(i,t)$:} \\ 
An multidimensional assignment rule $\delta(x)=\mathbf{1}_{\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{T}}$ 
exists which maps individuals to close to treatment status $C(i,t)$, where 
$\mathbf{X(i,t)}$ are observed covariates, and $\mathbb{T}$ is a fixed 
%but unknown (though reveal this and how to estimate it later)
function of $\mathbf{X(i,t)}$.
\end{assumption}

\begin{proposition}
\label{Pass:ATTnonP}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under assumptions \ref{Sass:PT}--\ref{Sass:SUTVAs} and \asref{Sass:SUTVAlM}{B}, 
the ATT and ATC can be consistently estimated by least squares when controlling, 
parametrically or non-parametrically, for $C(i,t)=\mathbf{1}_{\mathbf{x}\in
\mathbb{T}}$. 
\end{proposition}

Now, in the same manner, we can go about generating our estimands of interest, 
replacing $C(i,t)=\mathbf{1}_{X_i\leq d}$ with $C(i,t)=\mathbf{1}_{\mathbf{x}\in 
\mathbb{T}}$. The most compuationally demanding step in this estimation procedure 
is in forming a parametric or non-parametric version of the underlying function 
$R(i,t)$ to search over.  In a unidimensional framework it is reasonably 
straightforward to form local linear bins for $R(i,t)$.  However, in the 
multidimensional framework this is no longer the case.  Additionally, as the 
dimensionality of $\mathbf{X}$ rises, the number of search dimensions for 
spillovers also rises, leading to curse of dimensionality type considerations in 
the estimation of $\alpha$.

The particular functional form assigned to $R(i,t)$ will be context-specific,
and ideally driven by economic theory.  As mode of example, below we consider the
case where $R(i,t)=f(X_1,X_2)$ is a function of two variables, one binary and
the other continuous.  Such a case would be appropriate for a situation in which
spillovers depend upon distance to treatment and some indicator, such as exceeding
some income threshold.  Consider the case where $X_1\in \{0,1\}$ is binary, and 
$X_2$ continuous.  Then we can parametrise $R(i,t)$ as:
\begin{eqnarray}
R(i,t)&=&f(X_1,X_2) \nonumber \\
      &=&X_1\cdot[\beta_{0,1}X_2^1(i,t)+ \cdots + \beta_{0,K}X_2^K(i,t)] \nonumber \\
      &+& (1-X_1)\cdot[\beta_{1,1}X_2^1(i,t)+ \cdots + \beta_{1,K}X_2^K(i,t)]. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $X_2^k(i,t)$ is defined as per (\ref{Seqn:Rpar}).  Estimation of $\alpha$ 
can then proceed iteratively as in section \ref{Ssscn:TE}.  First a traditional 
DD parameter is estimated ignoring the possiblity that spillovers exist, leading 
to the proposed estimate $\hat\alpha^0$.  Then $X_1\cdot[\beta_{0,1}X_2^1(i,t)]$ 
and $(1-X_1)\cdot[\beta_{1,1}X^1(i,t)]$ are included in the regression, leading to 
an updated estimate $\hat\alpha^1$.  If the hypothesis $H_0: \alpha^0=\alpha^1$ 
cannot be rejected this suggests that spillovers are not a relevant phenomenon 
for either group, and the estimate of $\hat\alpha^0$ is accepted as the ATT.  
Otherwise, an additional iteration is made until the inclusion of the marginal 
$X_2^k(i,t)$ indicators for $X_1 \in \{0,1\}$ no longer affect the estimated 
effect $\alpha^k$.

%================================================================================
\section{An Empirical Illustration: Spillovers and Contraceptive Reforms}
We consider two empirical examples to motivate and demonstrate spillover-robust 
DD estimation.
We focus on two localised contraceptive reforms in different countries. The first
is the legalisation of abortion in Mexico city in April of 2007, and the second
the expansion of morning after pill availability in certain municipalities of 
Chile in 2008.  Both reforms were sharp, resulting in a large jump in reported
rates of contraceptive access, and arrived to only certain areas of the country.
In both cases, the geographic location of the reform was defined by the nature
of local municipal-level policies, resulting in seperate policies in different
municipalities in the country.\footnote{We refer to geographic units in each case
as municipalities.  In Mexico these are referred to as \emph{municipios}, or in 
the case of Mexico City \emph{delegaciones} and are the level below the State 
(there are 2,473 in total).  In Chile these are known as \emph{comunas}, (of 
which there are 346) and are also the level below the state.}

Contraceptive reform provides a useful test of a spillover-robust DD methodology.
Firstly, the arrival is plausibly exogenous at the level of the treated woman.
Secondly, the incentives to access contraceptives, especially post-coital 
treatments such as the morning after pill and abortion is high.  Even if a woman
is geographically excluded from a treatment municipality, given that the economic
and psychic costs of an undesired birth are very high, considerable incentives
will exist to travel to a treatment area from a non-treatment area to control
fertility.  Thirdly, contraceptive information may also be important in
determining contraceptive behaviour, and this information may travel through
(local) friendship networks.

Some further details regarding each reform are provided in the sections below.
In each case we estimate traditional difference-in-differences parameters under
the assumption that spillovers do not exist (and hence the SUTVA holds), and
then augment these estimates with the estimator discussed in the previous
sections.

\subsection{Abortion Reform in Mexico}
On April 24, 2007 Mexico City passed a law which which legalised abortion 
under all circumstances in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (see for example
\citet{Fraser2014} for a discussion).  This was a radical change from previous 
laws which outlawed abortion in all but the extreme circumstances of rape, 
to save the mother's life, or in the case of fetal inviability.  This law was 
\emph{only} passed in Mexico City (or \emph{Distrito Federal}), the 
administrative capital, and a region of Mexico containing approximately 8\% 
of the population.

This reform has had an important effect on birth rates among all age groups,
both according to administrative records, and to microeconometric estimates
(\citet{ClarkeMuhlrad2014} provide introductory figures of the effect of the
reform).  In this paper we examine only the effect of the reform on the total
number of teenage births.  Basic statistics for other age-groups, which show 
broadly similar patterns, are appended.  Full tables are available upon 
request.

Table \ref{Stab:headline} provides estimates of the effect of the reform on
the total number of births by teenagers in treatment municipalities.  In 
column 1 we estimate a specification similar to (\ref{Seqn:cDDconc}): the 
traditional DD estimate which does not account for spillovers.\footnote{Rather 
than estimating (\ref{Seqn:cDDconc}) precisely as written, we estimate a more 
flexible specification including time varying controls, full time and
municipality fixed effects, and municipal trends.  The intution however is
unchanged.}  This is then extended in columns 2 and 3 to account for spillovers
(if necessary).  Columns 2 and 3 present spillover-robust DD estimates, as 
described in section \ref{Sscn:estim} and equation (\ref{Seqn:cDD}).  In the
case that spillovers exist, and that these spillovers work in the same 
direction as the treatment effect itself, we should expect that we can reject
the null that $\beta<0$.  If however, $\hat\beta$ is not significantly 
different to zero, this suggests that areas `close to treatment' are not
different from areas far away from treatment, and that augmenting the 
specification to account for local spillovers is unnecessary.

\input{\sdidloc/tables/Headline.tex}

Estimates from table \ref{Stab:headline} suggest that, firstly, the effect of
the abortion policy is significant in magnitude.  It reduces births among 
teenagers by 125 births per municipality per year. When comparing this to the
average level of 1632.1 in treatment municipalities, this is a sizeable (and
statistically significant) effect.  When augmenting to control for local
spillovers in columns 2 and 3, it appears that municipalities `close to' 
treatment also are affected by the reform.  For those municipalities within
10km of treatment municipalities (but not themselves treated), the effect is 
a highly statistically significant reduction of approximately 120 births.
Column 3 extends to include a range of close controls.  Here it becomes
apparent that statistically significant effects remain at least up to areas
between 10 and 20km from the nearest treatment, and negative point estimates
only disappear when travelling greater than 30km away from treatment.

\end{footnotesize}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{SFig:MexClose} presents a graphical representation of estimates
of a vector of $\beta$ coefficients from equation (\ref{Seqn:cDD}).\footnote{
While here we focus on teenaged girls, appendix \ref{Sscn:Agraphs} presents
similar graphical results for other age groups.}  While the largest effect of 
treatment is felt in the treatment municipality itself, effects clearly remain 
even outside of treatment municipalities, suggesting that the spillover robust 
specification is necessary to estimate causal effects $\hat\alpha$ and 
$\hat\beta$.

\subsection{Emergency Contraceptive Reform in Chile}
After considerable juridical challenges against the legality of emergency 
(post-coital) contraception in the country, a Chilean constitutional tribunal in 
2008 issued a summary expressly allowing the morning after pill\footnote{The morning
  after pill is a hormonal treatment composed of progestin and estrogen which acts
to prevent ovulation after sexual intercourse in which alternative forms of 
contraceptives were not used, or believed to have failed.} to be prescribed
to women.  However, this finding was limited to municipal health centres, which
are administered by mayors and local governing councils.  This resulted in a 
period of approximately 4 years where the morning after pill was available to
women \emph{only} if the mayor of her municipality deemed it appropriate.  The
reform eventually resulted in morning after pill availability in approximately
150 of the 346 municipalities of the country (further figures and details of the
reform are discussed in \citet{Clarke2014}).

As for the case of the Mexico abortion reform, a `traditional' DD specification
is estimated, and compared with a spillover-robust DD estimator as proposed in
section \ref{Sscn:estim}.  A generalised version of (\ref{Seqn:cDDconc}) is 
estimated (where full year and municipal fixed effects are added, and municipal 
linear trends and time-varying controls are included), and compared to an 
identical version of the equation robust to spillovers between treatment and 
close-to-treatment areas (\ref{Seqn:cDD}).  If the traditional DD approach 
adequately captures the treatment, or in other words if SUTVA holds even locally,
then we should see two things: firstly, our estimate of $\alpha$ from 
(\ref{Seqn:cDDconc}) should not be significantly different to that from 
(\ref{Seqn:cDD}). Secondly, the coefficient on $R(i,t)$ should not be 
significantly different to zero.  Formally, if we cannot reject the null that 
$\beta=0$, this is evidence against the need for spillover robust DD in this 
case.

Columns 4 to 6 of table \ref{Stab:headline} present estimates from the Chile
reform.  In this case the variable $Y(i,t)$ represents the probability of giving
birth at time $t$, a binary outcome taking either 0 or 1 for each individual aged 
15-19 years. Column 4 presents an estimate where treatment is defined as having
the morning after pill available in the municipality where a woman lives one
year prior to the realised birth outcome (birth versus no birth).  The lag of
one year accounts for the mechanical delay in realisations of $Y(i,t)$ due to 
child gestation.  This alone suggests important effects of the reform: having the
reform available in the municipality of residence of the woman is associated with
a 4.2\% reduction in births the following year.  However, in columns (5) and (6),
we see that na\"ive estimates which fail to account for (local) spillovers 
\emph{understate} the true importance of the reform.  Column 5 suggests that
for girls living very close to the reform area, the reform appears to be at least
as important, even though their municipality is not directly treated.  Indeed,
we cannot reject tests for the equality of coefficients between those living
in treatment municipalities and those living within 10km of treatment 
municipalities.  Column 6 includes additional `close' binary variables, and
these tests suggest that the effect of the reform is able to travel around 30km;
reasonably similar to the effects of the Mexico abortion reform discussed in 
the previous section.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{\sdidloc/figures/ChileClose1.eps}
\caption{Treatment Effects: 15-19 year olds Chile}
\label{Sfig:ChileAlpha}
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{footnotesize}
\textsc{Notes to figure}: Each point represents a treatment effect on the treatment
area, conditioning on close controls for $d\in [0,45]$ km from the nearest treatment 
municipality.  As such, the point at 0 includes all municipalities with the exception
of treatment municipalities in the control group.  Standard errors are clustered at 
the level of the municipality.  Dotted lines display the 90\% confidence interval for 
all estimates.
\end{footnotesize}
\end{figure}

These results clearly suggest that we \emph{can} reject the null that $\beta=0$, as
a number of `close' coefficients are significant, in some cases even up to $p=0.01$.
However, tests directly on $\alpha$ do not allow for us to reject that values 
estimated for various models are significantly different.  Examining estimates 
$\hat\alpha$ more carefully suggests that as we move further away from the reform,
the effect size monotonically decreases (figure \ref{Sfig:ChileAlpha}).  This is
precisely in-line with what we would expect if SUTVA were violated locally, and
the cost (both psychic and economic) of travelling to treatment municipalities
increased with distance.

\subsection{Running Additional Placebo Tests}
Typically, DD estimates are presented along with placebo tests which define `false'
lagged reforms.  In other words, by examining outcomes entirely \emph{before} the
policy of interest has been implemented, null results are presented as evidence
in favour of an appropriately specified functional form of the DD set-up.

In the case of the spillover-robust DD estimate, there are now (at least) two
relevant placebos which should be tested.  Firstly, the reform must not have any
effect on outcomes \emph{before} treatment in treatment municipalities.  This is
precisely the same as the `traditional' placebo test described above.  Secondly
however, the reform should have no effect on predetermined outcomes in municipalites
\emph{close} to treatment municipalities.  Below we present an example of such 
placebo tests from the Mexico City abortion reform.  Now, as well as having a 
treatment estimate not significantly different from 0 (ie confidence intervals
at $distance=0$), the same result should hold for close municipalities ($distance>0$).

\section{Conclusion}
Echoing \citet{Bertrandetal2004}, ``Differences-in-Differences (DD) estimation 
has become an increasingly popular way to estimate causal relationships''.  
It is important to consider the assumptions underlying these estimators.  
In this paper we examine how DD estimates perform when the stable unit treatment 
value assumption does not hold locally.  Such a situation may be common in estimates 
of the causal effect of policy where compliance is imperfect.  If policies entail a 
benefit to recipients, and if recipients living `close to' treatment areas who are 
themselves untreated can somehow cross regional boundaries to receive treatment, we 
may be concerned that, locally at least, SUTVA is violated.

In this paper we derive a set of conditions by which DD estimates can produce 
unbiased estimates even in the absence of SUTVA between all units.  It is shown
that under a weaker set of conditions, both the average effect on the treated
and the average effect on the `close to treated' can be estimated in a DD-type
framework.  It is suggested that in the absence of this correction for local 
violations of SUTVA that (if spillovers actually \emph{do} occur) the true 
effect of the policy is likely to be attenuated.  Finally, using two empirical 
examples from recent contraceptive policy expansions, it is shown that this is%
---at least in these cases---an important consideration for treatment effects, 
and effects on nearby neighbourhoods.

\appendix
\section{Proofs}
\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{$\blacksquare$}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{Pass:ATT}]
\begin{footnotesize}
$Y(i,t)$ is generated according to (\ref{Seqn:COV}), and from (\ref{Seqn:cDD}),
a regression of $Y(i,t)$ on $D(i,t)$ and $C(i,t)$ can be estimated.  It is 
assumed that we have at a representative sample of size $N$ consisting of 
$\{Y(i,t),D(i,t),X(i,t): i=1, \ldots, N, t=0, 1\}$.  By assumption 
\asref{Sass:SUTVAl}{A}, the assignment rule $\delta$ forms $C(i,t)$ allowing for 
the estimation of (\ref{Seqn:cDD}). By definition, $\alpha$ in this regression 
is equal to:
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\label{Seqn:alphaProof1}
\begin{split}
\alpha&=\{\mathbb{E}[Y(i,1)|D(i,1)=1,R(i,1)=0]-\mathbb{E}[Y(i,1)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)=0]\} \\
      &-\{\mathbb{E}[Y(i,0)|D(i,1)=1,R(i,1)=0]-\mathbb{E}[Y(i,0)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)=0]\},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and from assumption \ref{Sass:SUTVAs}, each of the expectation terms exists, as 
there are both fully treated and completely untreated units. Using the potential 
outcomes framework, we are free to re-write the above expression as:
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\label{Seqn:alphaProof2}
\begin{split}
\alpha&=\{\mathbb{E}[Y^1(i,1)|D(i,1)=1,R(i,1)=0]-\mathbb{E}[Y^0(i,1)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)=0]\} \\
      &-\{\mathbb{E}[Y^0(i,0)|D(i,1)=1,R(i,1)=0]-\mathbb{E}[Y^0(i,0)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)=0]\},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
given that only in the case where $t=1$ and $D(i,1)=1$ we observe the potential 
outcome where the individual receives treatment: $Y^1(i)$.  Using the linearity
of the expectations operator, this can finally be re-written as:
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\label{Seqn:alphaProof3}
\alpha=\mathbb{E}[Y^1(i,1)-Y^0(i,0)|D(i,1)=1,R(i,1)=0] - 
       \mathbb{E}[Y^0(i,1)-Y^0(i,0)|D(i,1)=0,R(i,1)=0].
\end{equation}

Now, from assumption \ref{Sass:PT}, we can appeal to parallel trends, and 
replace the second expectation term in the above expression with $\mathbb{E}
[Y^0(i,1)-Y^0(i,0)|D(i,1)=1,R(i,1)=0]$:
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\label{Seqn:alphaProof4}
\alpha=\mathbb{E}[Y^1(i,1)-Y^0(i,0)|D(i,1)=1,R(i,1)=0] - \mathbb{E}[Y^0(i,1)-Y^0(i,0)|D(i,1)=1,R(i,1)=0].
\end{equation}
Expanding the expectations operator and cancelling out the second term in each of
the above items gives:
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\label{Seqn:alphaProof5}
\alpha=\mathbb{E}[Y^1(i,1)|D(i,1)=1,R(i,1)=0] - \mathbb{E}[Y^0(i,1)|D(i,1)=1,R(i,1)=0].
\end{equation}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
which finally, once again by the linearity of expectations, can be combined to 
give $\alpha=\mathbb{E}[Y^1(i,1)-Y^0(i,1)|D(i,1)=1,R(i,1)=0]$, which can be 
rewritten as $\alpha=\mathbb{E}[Y^1(i,1)-Y^0(i,1)|D(i,1)=1]$ given that $D(i,1)=1 
\implies R(i,1)=0$.  From (\ref{Seqn:estimATT}) we thus have that $\alpha=ATT$ 
as required.

Turning to the ATC, the same set of steps can be followed for $\beta$ on the 
coefficient $R(i,t)$, however now instead of assumption \ref{Sass:PT} we must
rely on parallel-trend assumption \ref{Sass:PTC}. This leads to $\beta=
\mathbb{E}[Y^1(i,1)-Y^0(i,1)|R(i,1)\neq 1]$, and from (\ref{Seqn:estimATC}) we 
have that $\beta=ATC$.
\end{footnotesize}
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{Pass:ATTnonP}]
\begin{footnotesize}
With the representative sample $\{Y(i,t), D(i,t), \mathbf{X}(i,t): i=1, \ldots, N, 
t=0, 1\}$, assumption \asref{Sass:SUTVAlM}{B} implies that $\mathbf{X}(i,t)$ can
be $C(i,t)$ using assignment rule $\delta$.  The remainder of the proof follows
the same steps as the proof for proposition \ref{Pass:ATT}.
\end{footnotesize}
\end{proof}

\section{A Structural Interpretation of Spillover-Robust Difference-in-Difference Estimation}
The framework discussed in this paper can be motivated in terms of a simple
structural model in the style of \citet{Roy1951}, or 
\citet{HeckmanVytlacil2005}.\footnote{While the \citet{Roy1951} model is not
cast in terms of causal effects, it does consider selection based on relative
utility.  The so-called ``Generalised Roy Model'' laid out in 
\citet{HeckmanVytlacil2005} is a more appropriate framework for this analysis.}
To start, potential outcomes are written as:
\[
Y_0= \mu_0(X) + U_0
\]
and
\[
Y_1= \mu_1(X) + U_1.
\]
Treatment assignment $T=1$ and $T=0$ are observed.  Each individual decides
whether to opt in to treatment $D$, given their realisation of $X$ and $T$,
along with the costs of participation:
\[
C=\mu_c(Z,T)+U_c.
\]
Their decision rule depends upon net utility:
\[
D^{*}=Y_1-Y_0-C,
\]
and can be expressed as: $D=\mathbf{1}_{D^{*}\geq 0}$.  Structural estimation
relies on the assumption $(X,Z,T) \independent (U_0,U_1,U_c)$.\footnote{Note
that the parallel trend assumption is a linear form of this.}  Note that in 
the above specification, the costs of participation are explicitly allowed 
to depend upon treatment assignment status $T$. This is a cost associated with
defying the treatment status.

Attach functionl forms: $\mu_0(X)=X\beta_0$, $\mu_1(X)=X\beta_1$, 
$\mu_c(Z,T)=Z\beta_{cz}+T\beta_{cT}$, and distributional assumptions for the
unobserved components: $(U_0,U_1,U_c)\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)$
