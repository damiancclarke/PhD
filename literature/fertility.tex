Child-bearing decisions are not made in isolation.  They are taken in concert 
with decisions regarding work, marriage, health investments and stocks, as well 
as many other observable and non-observable considerations.  Drawing causal 
inferences regarding the effect of child birth is complicated by these 
endogenous factors.  This review chapter outlines the identification of causal
estimates of fertilty, and the assumptions underlying the range of estimators
and methodologies proposed in the economic, as well as the non-economic, 
literature.

\section{The Effects of Family Size on Children}
In 1973, the \emph{Journal of Political Economy} released a special issue 
dedicated to new economic approaches to fertility.  Interest in determining
the causal effect of total fertility on the outcomes of children in the 
household blossomed from the articles it contained.  A common theme in a number 
of articles in this issue \citep{BeckerLewis1973, DeTray1973, Willis1973} 
concerns a family's decisions regarding fertility (the quantity of children) 
and investments in child human capital (the `quality' of children). Abstracting 
from intra-household variations in child quality, each of the aforementioned
articles demonstrates the theoretical existence of a quantity--quality
(Q--Q trade-off).\footnote{As \citet{Willis1973} succinctly describes:
\begin{quote}
`Thus, parents not only balance the satisfactions they receive from their
children against those received from all other sources not related to 
children \ldots, but they must also decide whether to augment their 
satisfaction from children at the ``extensive'' margin by having another
child or at the ``intensive'' margin by adding to the quality of a given
number of children.'
\end{quote}
}

The Q--Q trade-off described in the above series of articles as well as in
\citet{BeckerTomes1976,BeckerTomes1986} owes to the joint entry of quality and 
quantity in the household budget constraint.  As the number of children 
enters in the shadow price of quality, and the quality of desired children 
enters the shadow price for quantity, decisions regarding fertility and quality 
must be taken jointly.  Holding all else constant, increases in fertility 
increase the shadow price of quality, and increases in quantity increases the
shadow price of the marginal birth. This considerably complicates causal 
inference. What's more, as recognised in early articles by \citet{%
BenPorathWelch1972,BenPorath1976}, quality decisions may \emph{directly} feed 
back to quantity via child mortality.

\textcolor{red}{Discussion of assumptions of Q--Q...
 examine the effect of child 
characteristics (mortality) on family size., and loosening by 
\citet{AizerCunha2012} (from \citet{Behrmanetal1982}'s theory, gender discussion 
of \citet{ButcherCase1994}) recently. \citet{Lawsonetal2012} is one of many 
biological papers.}

\subsection{Instrumental Variables}
In systems of equations of this type, one way to drive inference is through the
use of shifters (or instrumental variables) which affect the quantity of one of
the variables without affecting the other.  In order to identify the effect of 
fertility on children's outcomes, this instrumental variable must affect only 
fertility, with no indirect effects on quality.\footnote{\emph{Ie} the exclusion 
restriction must hold, implying that the estimation of the structural equation 
which contains quality on fertilty and the instrument must result in a 
coefficient on the instrumental variable which is precisely equal to zero.}
Returning to the nomenclature introduced in section \ref{Fscn:causality},

\citet{Bougmaetal2015,Blacketal2005,Blacketal2010,
Angristetal2010,ConleyGlauber2006,
RosenzweigWolpin1980,Beckeretal2010,MillimetWang2011,Lee2008}
Note (or footnote) the birth order discussion in \citet{Blacketal2005}.

Make table of potential biases...  Ie we know that coefficient between 
instrument and fertility is +/-.  Then if correlation between instrument
and error is +/-, this implies:
